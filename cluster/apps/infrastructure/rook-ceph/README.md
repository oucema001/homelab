# ☠ Rook Ceph Cluster ☠

Here lies my old rook/ceph cluster. Hyperconverged, single node, single mon, single mgr, single OSD per disk, consumer grade disks. She just wasn't built to last.

[The death knell](https://github.com/clearlybaffled/homelab/issues/26)

Maybe, one day, when my lab grows up to have some real servers with real disk drives
lots of cores, tons of RAM, multiple nodes, it'll make sense to bring this back.

But for the meantime, localPath PV/PVCs sound so much more manageable now.
